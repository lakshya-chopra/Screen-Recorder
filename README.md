# Screen-Recorder
This is a basic screen recorder program written in python

**Packages used : pyautogui,win32api,opencv,numpy and datetime.**

**Different Filename for each Recording:**\
The filename is different for all the recordings since we are getting the timestamp each and every time we are running the project and concatenating it with '.mp4'.The result 
would be the stored as the filename.
